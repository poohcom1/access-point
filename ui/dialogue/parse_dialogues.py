Aeonia: "...we were forced to encrypt our message in case it was intercepted", "As for other information, I don't have much", "No records of these creatures exist but they seem to be intelligent enough to be able to intercept and disrupt our comm systems both on and off-world" 
Mars: "That explains why I lost contact with HQ...", "how are we communicating right now?"
Aeonia: "We have been sending out messages on all frequencies regularly since main comms cut out after the first distress call", "You are the first response we have had back"
Mars: "Ok", "You mentioned a base", "Are you able to track my position or guide me there?"
Aeonia: "Negative", "We have no systems online that can track your position", "However, you should be able to follow the radar waypoints back to base", "That's how all our comms get transmitted on-world"
Mars: "And just exactly how long do you think that might take?"
Aeonia: "Anywhere between a few hours to a few days or weeks"
Mars: "...okay then"
